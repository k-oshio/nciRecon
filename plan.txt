	NIRS current (2018-2019)
		1. continuous optical stim (~0.2 sec stim / 1 sec) (NCI)
		2. ~0.2sec stim, on for 10 sec, off for 10 sec (BOLD + NCI)
		3. continuously alternating checkerbord stim, 10 sec on, 10 sec off (BOLD)

==== seq differences
	sRXSPEC.alDwellTime[0] = 2600	// NIRS
	alTR[0] = 1000000

	sRXSPEC.alDwellTime[0] = 2000	// Ogawa

plans

- BOLD signal is detected by 1 Hz filtering (10sample avg), PCA etc. (mag, ser2 & 3)
- There is 1.00 Hz signal (phase). Source is unknown (compressor ?)
	-> remove by filtering
- No clear BOLD signal on phase. ~1Hz signal (cardiac) seems to corespond to BOLD
	-> chk correlation with arterial and venous signal

==== final report for NIRS 5-10-2019

==== next phase (started on 12-16-2019) ====

- model / hypothesis based processing
		signal accumulation, moving average, low freq BPF
		mag first (nciRec12.m)

- combined processing (BOLD and NCI) 12-18-2019
	no PCA -> no mag mask
	== BOLD side ==
	1. 1st BOLD estimate by projecting time signal to response curve (model)
	2. Place ROI at large response area
	3. 2nd BOLD estimate by projecting ROI signal to response
	4. caclurate "response index" (signal / model correlation)
	5. weighted sum -> final BOLD response
	== NCI side ==
	6. 1st NCI estimate by cumulative filter + projection onto model
	7. identify response area
	8. calc "BOLD response index" & NCI correlation
	9. NCI average by weighting by "BOLD response index"

- K+ imaging (accumulated white matter current) 6-16-2020
	1. chk all protocols (including NCI only)
	2. chk whole brain data (obata, 11-28-2018)
